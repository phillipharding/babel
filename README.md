## Overview

* [Search Trimming] - Disable/Enable Search Trimming
* [SharePoint-CSOM] - PowerShell + CSOM Provisioning Library

## Search Trimming

Disables search trimming in Search Results Webparts

## SharePoint-CSOM

A feature complete set of Powershell + CSOM commandlets which let you create, provision and configure SharePoint 2013 (On-Premise and Online) artefacts.

The commandlets are driven by an XML dataset which you have to author, this XML dataset has roughly 90% parity with the CAML provisioning schema.
